# adapt-contrib-hotgraphic

**Hot Graphic** is a *presentation component* bundled with the [Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework).
<img src="https://github.com/adaptlearning/documentation/blob/master/04_wiki_assets/plug-ins/images/hotgraphic01.gif" alt="Hot Graphic in action">

When a learner clicks on a hot spot within the image, a pop-up is displayed that consists of text with an image. [Visit the **Hot Graphic** wiki](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-hotgraphic/wiki) for more information about its functionality and for explanations of key properties.

In the standard configuration, the 'hot spots' are clickable 'pin' icons overlaying the main image - but it's possible to replace the default 'pin' icon with a custom image (see the [_pin](#_pin-object) setting for more information) or, using the [_useGraphicsAsPins](#_usegraphicsaspins-boolean) setting, create a 'tiled layout' of images where each 'tile' acts as a hot spot.

By default, when the viewport size changes to the smallest range, this component will behave like a [**Narrative** component](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-narrative). All information will remain available but formatted as a narrative rather than as hot spots on a graphic. This behaviour can be overridden by changing the [_isNarrativeOnMobile](#_isnarrativeonmobile-boolean) setting to `false`.

## Installation

As one of Adapt's *[core components](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-Plug-ins-in-the-Adapt-Learning-Framework#components),* **Hot Graphic** is included with the [installation of the Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Manual-installation-of-the-Adapt-framework#installation) and the [installation of the Adapt authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-Adapt-Origin).

* If **Hot Graphic** has been uninstalled from the Adapt framework, it may be reinstalled.
With the [Adapt CLI](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-cli) installed, run the following from the command line:
    ```console
    adapt install adapt-contrib-hotgraphic
    ```

    Alternatively, this component can also be installed by adding the following line of code to the *adapt.json* file:
    ```json
    "adapt-contrib-hotgraphic": "*"
    ```
    Then running the command:
    ```console
    adapt install
    ```
    (This second method will reinstall all plug-ins listed in *adapt.json*.)

* If **Hot Graphic** has been uninstalled from the Adapt authoring tool, it may be reinstalled using the [Plug-in Manager](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Plugin-Manager).

## Settings Overview

The attributes listed below are used in *components.json* to configure **Hot Graphic**, and are properly formatted as JSON in [*example.json*](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-hotgraphic/blob/master/example.json). Visit the [**Hot Graphic** wiki](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-hotgraphic/wiki) for more information about how they appear in the [authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki).

## Attributes

[**core model attributes**](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes): These are inherited by every Adapt component. [Read more](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes).

### \_component (string):
This must be set to: `"hotgraphic"`.

### \_classes (string):
CSS class name(s) to be applied to this component's containing `div`. The class must be predefined in one of the Less files. Separate multiple classes with a space.

### \_layout (string):
This defines the horizontal position of the component in the block. Acceptable values are `full`, `left` or `right`.

### instruction (string):
This optional text appears above the component. It is frequently used to
guide the learner’s interaction with the component.

### mobileBody (string):
This is optional text that will be substituted for `body` when `device.screenSize` is `small` (i.e. when viewed on mobile devices, except when the [_isNarrativeOnMobile](#_isnarrativeonmobile-boolean) setting is set to `false`).

### mobileInstruction (string):
This is optional text that will be substituted for `instruction` when `device.screenSize` is `small` (i.e. when viewed on mobile devices, except when the [_isNarrativeOnMobile](#_isnarrativeonmobile-boolean) setting is set to `false`).

### \_isMobileTextBelowImage (boolean):
Like `mobileBody` and `mobileInstruction`, `_isMobileTextBelowImage` is only applicable when `device.screenSize` is `small` (i.e. when viewed on mobile devices, except when the [_isNarrativeOnMobile](#_isnarrativeonmobile-boolean) setting is set to `false`). The default is `false`. When set to `true`, the replacement Narrative will not use the default "strapline" layout. Instead both the image and text of each stage remain visible, with the text positioned below the image.

### \_setCompletionOn (string):
Determines when Adapt will register this component as having been completed by the learner. Acceptable values are `"allItems"` and `"inview"`. `"allItems"` requires each pop-up item to be visited. `"inview"` requires the **Hot Graphic** component to enter the view port completely.

### \_canCycleThroughPagination (boolean):
Enables the pop-ups to be cycled through endlessly using either the previous or next icon. When set to `true`, clicking "next" on the final stage will display the very first stage. When set to `false`, the final stage will display only a "previous" icon. The default is `false`.

### \_hidePagination (boolean):
When set to `true`, hides the "previous" and "next" icons and progress indicator (e.g., "1/5") on the pop-up's toolbar. The default is `false`.

### \_isNarrativeOnMobile (boolean):
When set to `false` the Hotgraphic will render a scaled down 'desktop' version (pins over image / tiles) of the component in mobile view instead of being replaced by a Narrative interaction. The default is `true`.

### \_useNumberedPins (boolean):
If set to `true`, the pin icons will be replaced with the item number. Useful if you want pins to be visited in a set order or show steps in a process. The default is `false`.

### \_useGraphicsAsPins (boolean):
If set to `true`, the image specified by `_graphic.src` will be ignored and the popup images specified in `_items[n]._graphic.src` will instead be laid out in a 2 item width grid system. See [example.json](example.json#L79-L115) for a working example. The default is `false`.

### \_isRound (boolean):
If set to `true`, the popup images will inherit a 50% border radius. Ideal for use with images that are square that are required to be round. The default is `false`.

### \_tooltip (object):

#### \_isEnabled (boolean):
When set to `true` the tooltip will be shown on hover over the item. The default is `false`.

#### text (string):
The text to display when the user hovers over the item.

### \_graphic (object):
The graphic object that defines the image over which the hot spots are rendered (except when the [_useGraphicsAsPins](#_usegraphicsaspins-boolean) setting is enabled). It contains the following settings:

#### src (string):
File name (including path) of the image. Path should be relative to the `src` folder (e.g. `"course/en/images/origami-menu-two.jpg"`).

#### alt (string):
The alternative text for this image. Assign [alt text](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Providing-good-alt-text) to images that convey course content only.

#### attribution (string):
Optional text to be displayed as an [attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution). By default it is displayed below the image. Adjust positioning by modifying CSS. Text can contain HTML tags, e.g., `Copyright © 2015 by <b>Lukasz 'Severiaan' Grela</b>`.

### \_items (array):
Multiple items may be created. Each entry in the array should be an object, containing the following settings:

#### \_top (number):
Each item must contain `_top` and `_left` coordinates to define its position over the main graphic. Enter a percentage value (0-100) that this item should be from the top border of the main graphic.

#### \_left (number):
Enter a percentage value (0-100) that this item should be from the left border of the main graphic.

#### title (string):
This is the title text for the hot spot's pop-up.

#### \_ariaLevel (number):
ARIA level to assign to the popup title. If not set, it will default to using the value assigned to `_notify` in the `_accessibility` section of config.json.

#### body (string):
This is the main text for a hot spot pop-up.

#### strapline (string):
This text is displayed when `device.screenSize` is `small` (i.e. when viewed on mobile devices, except when the [_isNarrativeOnMobile](#_isnarrativeonmobile-boolean) setting is set to `false`). It is presented in a title bar above the image.

#### \_imageAlignment (string):
Defines the horizontal alignment of the item image in the pop up. Left: Image aligned to the left of the text area. Right: Image aligned to the right of the text area. The default alignment is `right`.

#### \_classes (string):
CSS class name(s) to be applied to the popup item. Classes available by default are:
* `"hide-desktop-image"` (hides the pop up image in desktop view)
* `"hide-popup-image"` (hides the pop up image for all screen sizes)

Any other classes need to be predefined in one of the Less files. Separate multiple classes with a space.

#### \_graphic (object):
The image that is associated with this item - which will be displayed in a popup when the pin is selected by the learner (although note that the [_useGraphicsAsPins](#_usegraphicsaspins-boolean) setting allows for it to be used as a 'tile' in the main image instead). It contains the following settings:

##### src (string):
File name (including path) of the image. Path should be relative to the `src` folder (e.g. `"course/en/images/origami-menu-two.jpg"`).

##### alt (string):
The alternative text for this image. Assign [alt text](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Providing-good-alt-text) to images that convey course content only.

##### attribution (string):
Optional text to be displayed as an [attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution). By default it is displayed below the image. Adjust positioning by modifying CSS. Text can contain HTML tags, e.g., `Copyright © 2015 by <b>Lukasz 'Severiaan' Grela</b>`.

##### \_classes (string):
CSS class name(s) to be applied to hotgraphic pin or, alternatively, to the hotspot tile when [_useGraphicsAsPins](#_usegraphicsaspins-boolean) is set to `true`. The class must be predefined in one of the Less files. Separate multiple classes with a space.

#### \_pin (object):
Optional image that can appear instead of the default pin icon. See [example.json](example.json#L117-L160) for a working example. It contains the following settings:

##### src (string):
File name (including path) of the image. Path should be relative to the `src` folder (e.g. `"course/en/images/origami-menu-two.jpg"`).

##### alt (string):
The alternative text for this image. Assign [alt text](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Providing-good-alt-text) to images that convey course content only.

## Accessibility
**Hot Graphic** has two elements assigned a label using the [aria-label](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Aria-Labels) attribute: **ariaRegion** and **popupPagination**. These labels are not visible elements. They are utilized by assistive technology such as screen readers. Should the label texts need to be customised, they can be found within the **globals** object in [*properties.schema*](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-hotgraphic/blob/master/properties.schema).
